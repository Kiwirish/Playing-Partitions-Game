# Playing Partitions Ferrers Board Game Simulation

### PlayingPartitions is a project that simulates a Ferrers board partition game where players make moves to transform an initial partition into a goal partition. 
### The game determines the outcome based on the initial and goal partitions, with each partition being assigned a mood: happy, sad, or neutral. 

### The project uses depth-first search (DFS) to evaluate game states and determine the outcome for each partition configuration.
